### 🚀 "Production" app running [here](https://stream.gatsbyjs.io/)!

# 🔥 Getting started
1. `npm install`
2. `yarn develop` or `yarn start`

# ✨ My favorite parts of this exercise
* I really liked how doing this project gave me a ton of experience working with Stream's chat! I ended up spending a lot of time going through various documentation and source code to learn how to do things like create custom components, override styles, and create users and channels. 


* I got to make another app with Gatsby!


* I used Framer Motion for some nice interactions. My two favorites are how the hospital statistics cards slide in on page load and the pulsating notification dots on icon hover.


* I made the assumption that component libraries were off-limits for this exercise, so I made all the components by hand with the help of Styled Components

# ⏱️ Things I'd like to do if I had more time
* I really like to make the app responsive. The current code does fine on larger viewports, but I'd love to take another pass to allow this app to look great on tablet and mobile viewports.


* I'd love to switch up the file structure to something that would allow me to split up the code a bit more. Some component files got pretty large due to having React, Styled Components, and Framer Motion code in them.


* Re-approach how I integrated Stream chat into the app. I kept the integration of chat for last— Running out of time, I still wanted to honor the deadline I gave myself of Monday, so I styled this part of the app in a way that falls short of my own standards. I'd love to be able to start fresh on this, and learn the best way to integrate and customize this integration for a React app.


* More animations with Framer Motion, because who doesn't like more animations? Especially a route animation between dashboard and doctor profiles, also some kind of scale animation with color when the user clicks on one of the hospital statistic cards.


* Flush out the common components a bit more (e.g. Button, Card, Text Input, etc.). Since I was on a time crunch, I implemented these common components enough to work for this exercise only. 


* Automated tests using react-testing-library!


* Improve the apps' Lighthouse score

# 📈 Possible improvement ideas for Stream
* I think the JS/Node code example for client is outdated in this section: App Overview > Integration dialog > JS/Node tab


* Live code frames on the documentation pages (e.g. [this page](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/react/custom-code-examples/channel_list_preview/))
  * Also provide links to one or more sandboxes so users can see everything in action.
